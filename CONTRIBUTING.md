# Contributing

To ensure the long-term stability and quality of this project, we are moving to a closed-contribution model effective August 2025. This change allows our core team to focus on a centralized development roadmap and rigorous quality assurance, which is essential for a component with such extensive usage.

All of our development will remain public for transparency. We thank the community for its support and valuable contributions.
