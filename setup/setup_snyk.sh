# This can be a standard version (ie. v1.390.0) or it can be latest, in which case the
# latest released version will be used.
#
# The second argument is the platform, in the format used by the `runner.os` context variable
# in GitHub Actions. Note that this script does not currently support Windows based environments.
#
# As an example, the following would install the latest version of Snyk for GitHub Actions for
# a Linux runner:
#
#     ./snyk-setup.sh latest Linux
